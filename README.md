# Finite-State-Machine-Design
 Designed a sequence detection circuit using both Moore and Mealy FSM, Design was implemented HDL Language Used: verilog

 # ðŸ”„ Finite State Machine Sequence Detector (Moore & Mealy)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements **both Moore and Mealy finite state machines (FSMs)** in Verilog HDL to detect a specific binary sequence (`1011`).  
The aim was to compare Moore and Mealy designs in terms of timing, output behavior, and complexity.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Sequence: `1011`
- **Moore FSM**: Output depends only on the current state (stable but slightly delayed).
- **Mealy FSM**: Output depends on current state & input (faster but can be glitchy).
- Testbenches for both FSMs.
- Self-checking verification for multiple input patterns.
